# qb-packet-reader
- a quizbug/protobowl/tkbot where you can input a packet
- check out the website at https://quizbowl-packet-reader.herokuapp.com/
- a useful packet parser I used: https://github.com/alopezlago/YetAnotherPacketParser
- credit also goes to https://github.com/kgurazad/quizbug2 as i probably could not have done this without consulting this

## how to use
- run the server file by using the command `node server.js` (this requires node.js installed on your computer, I have version 14.16.0)
- website will appear at localhost:3000
